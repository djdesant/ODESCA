    %ODESCA_BaseClass Base Class for all classes in ODESCA
    %
    % DESCRIPTION
    %   This class is the base class for all classes used in ODESCA. It
    %   stores the current version number of ODESCA aswell as the version
    %   number the instance was created in. This second version number is 
    %   saved with the instance if the save command is used and can be seen 
    %   after loading the instance even if the version of the class 
    %   definition has changed.
