function calculationCorrect = tryCalculateEquations(obj)
% Calculates the equations if all construction parameters are set.
%
% SYNTAX
%   obj.tryCalculateEquations()
%   calculationPossible = obj.tryCalculateEquations()
%
% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%   obj:    Instance of the object where the method was
%           called. This parameter is given automatically.
%
% OPTIONAL INPUT ARGUMENTS
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
%   calculationPossible: true, if all construction parameters are set
%
% DESCRIPTION
%   This method triggers the calculation of the equations f and g if two
%   conditions are met:
%       1: The equations have not been calculated already.
%           -> If the equations were calculated before, changes may have
%              been made to the component which would be lost if the
%              equations are calculated again.
%       2: If there are construction parameters they have to be set
%           -> The construction parameters are necessary for the
%              calculation of the equations therefore all of them have to
%              be set.
%   If the construction parameters are not set, the method returns false
%   and a warning is thrown. Otherwise the method returns true. 
%   If the calculation is triggerd the method afterwards checks if the
%   equations are calculated correctly (wright number and symbolic
%   expressions in it, see checkEquationsCorrect). If this is not the case,
%   the method throws a warning.
%
% NOTE
%   - It is necessary to have the calculation in an extra method
%     because on initialization the forced parameters are not set.

% EXAMPLE
%    Pipe = OCLib_Pipe('MyPipe');
%    calculationPossible_before = Pipe.tryCalculateEquations
%    Pipe.setConstructionParam('Nodes',2);
%    calculationPossible_after = Pipe.tryCalculateEquations
