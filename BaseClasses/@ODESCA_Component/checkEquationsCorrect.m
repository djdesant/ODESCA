function equationsCorrect = checkEquationsCorrect(obj)
% Check if all equations were set correctly
%
% SYNTAX
%   equationCorrect = obj.checkEquationsCorrect()
%
% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%   obj:    Instance of the object where the method was
%           called. This parameter is given automatically.
%
% OPTIONAL INPUT ARGUMENTS
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
%   equationsCorrect: boolean, true if all equations are set correctly
%
% DESCRIPTION
%   This method checks if all equations are set correctly. This is the case
%   if the equations have the same number of elements as the names for the
%   equations, are symbolic and do not hold any symbolic variables which
%   are not part of the component.
%
% NOTE
%
% SEE ALSO
%   ODESCA_Object.isValidSymbolic()
%
% EXAMPLE
%   Pipe = OCLib_Pipe('MyPipe');
%   equationCorrect = Pipe.checkEquationsCorrect()
