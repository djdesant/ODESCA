% Sets all steady states to invalid on a change in the equations and
% calculates the new valid steady states

% SYNTAX
%
% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%   obj:    Instance of the object where the method was
%           called. This parameter is given automatically.

%
% DESCRIPTION
%   This method sets all the steady states of the system to a invalid state
%   if the equations of the systems where changed.
%
% NOTE
%   - This method is a implementation of the same named abstract method of
%     the ODESCA_Object
%   - This method is not supposed to be used by a user.

%
% EXAMPLE
%     There is no example provided because this method is not supposed to
%     be used by a user.

%% Evaluation of the task
% Set all steady states to invalid
if( ~isempty(sys.steadyStates) )
   for num = 1:numel(sys.steadyStates)
       ss = sys.steadyStates(num);
       ss.structuralValid = false;
       ss.numericValid = false;
   end
end

% empty the struct of valid steady states
sys.validSteadyStates = [];
